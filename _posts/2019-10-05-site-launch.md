Finally started working on putting this website together, yay! It's powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and html Markdown can be used to author posts. I have to thank Jonathan Mcglone for his [step-by-step guide](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) to build GitHub Pages and certainly GitHub as well for providing this service.
